Both of these take a bit to build on the c201 and don't 
build properly in the chroot so there precompiled versions here.
When PrawnOS has its own apt repos these will be available there... 

If you want to build them yourself run:

For libinput-gestures:
sudo apt install -y libinput-tools xdotool build-essential
git clone http://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures
cd libinput-gestures
sudo make install 

For Xfdashboard:
apt-get install -y xfce4-dev-tools build-essential glib2.0 libglib2.0-dev xorg-dev libwnck-3-dev libclutter-1.0-dev libgarcon-1-0-dev libxfconf-0-dev libxfce4util-dev libxfce4ui-2-dev libxcomposite-dev libxdamage-dev libxinerama-dev
git clone https://github.com/gmc-holle/xfdashboard
#get most recent version I've tested
cd xfdashboard
git checkout a7851d82ec89b3cd49952c6022813bbe6b8b0bc9
sudo ./autogen.sh
sudo make 
sudo make install
